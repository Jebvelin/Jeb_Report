# Web Template

This project serves as a basic web template for building web applications. It includes a simple HTML structure, a JavaScript file for interactivity, and a package.json for managing dependencies.

## Project Structure

```
web-template
├── public
│   └── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── src
│   └── main.js          # JavaScript file for interactivity
├── package.json          # npm configuration file
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

To get started with this web template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd web-template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   You can use a local server to serve the `public/index.html` file. For example, you can use the `live-server` package:
   ```
   npx live-server public
   ```

## Usage

- Modify the `public/index.html` file to change the structure and content of your web application.
- Add your JavaScript code in the `src/main.js` file to implement functionality and interactivity.
- Update the `package.json` file to manage dependencies and scripts as needed.
